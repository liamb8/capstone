# Cyberlabs Project
Welcome to Cyberlabs - a set of cybersecurity training resources focusing on host-based and network security. This repository was created as an aid for CyberPatriot students to help establish a common set of training materials that can be accessible to all competitors, regardless of direct mentorship received. These lab guides are intended to cover the fundamental parts of host-based and network security that students may encounter both in a competition and in a real-world environment. Content is aimed at novice security practitioners with additional advanced concepts presented in a digestible way.

Lab Requirements
Lab environments are distributed as Virtual Machines in OVA files or VMX files. Linux environments can be directly downloaded and run as an appliance in Virtualization software.
